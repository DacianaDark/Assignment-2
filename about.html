                    <h4>On Our Way</h4>
                    <p>In May of 2023 I was fortunate enough to be selected to take part in the Student abroad program
                        at with the University of Lethbridge and the Universidad Intercultural Maya de Quintana Roo.</p>
                    <p>The University is in the city of Jose Maria Morelos in the heart of Quintana Roo, this city is
                        home to about 12,000 people who are of Mayan decent and Maya is the dominant language with
                        Spanish being spoken a close second.</p>
                    <p>Our time in this university was spent learning Mayan history, language and current practices.</p>

                    <h4>Language Lessons</h4>
                    <p>The language classes were difficult but I ended up getting a grasp on things, to the point I was
                        able to order what I wanted to eat in a restaurant with ease. We learned Mayan along side
                        Spanish and I quite enjoyed the Mayan lessons as the Mayan culture is a culture I have been
                        fascinated with for a long time</p>
                    <p>Mayan lessons ended up being one of my favourite classes though I lost some of the language upon
                        returning home, I can think back to when my friends and I would say how we were feeling in
                        Mayan.</p>
                    <p>We also took Spanish lessons but I struggled so hard, I eventually was able to order food and
                        make purchases in the shop, but it took a long time.</p>

                    <h4>The Best Way to Experience Culture</h4>
                    <p>Despite that I did get sick in Mexico prior to getting sick we had some amazing food albeit
                        getting a bit tired of tortillas - they are served with every meal. We did have some traditional
                        Mayan foods, none of which I got pictures of because I was so fascinated that I was eating
                        ancient recipes</p>

                    <h4>Weekend Trips</h4>
                    <p>We did get to travel outside of class and experience some of the life away from University in the
                        first weekend we went to Bacalar, the second weekend was touring around Jose Maria Morelos and
                        the last weekend was a trip to Chichen Itza and Merida. Plot twist I nearly died at Chichen Itza
                        due to the heat, that heat doesn't mess around.</p>
                    <p>We also went to a small home business where a group of women make traditional clothing and do the
                        stitching right there. I treated myself to a very pretty embrodered necklace.</p>
